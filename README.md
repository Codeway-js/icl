# interpretor for codway langage (icl)
## install
it is a CLI so you must global install like that:
`npm i -g icl`
## use
there 2 mode:

-command line (-n)

-file (-o)
### exemple
from file:

`icl -o path/to/file`

or directly in the terminal:

`icl -n ConstOil.logik\(\"hello World\"\)`
### syntaxe
the changement to cl and js is syntaxe of word(the main syntaxe is the same).
for exemple: for become farand this for all the world in the [translate.json file](https://github.com/Codeway-js/icl/blob/main/bin/translate.json)
#### /!\ the problem is you can not use this word in a variable name (in string is good)

### contributing
there are just few words in the translate file to add word do a fork from github and I would see for adding
(Words must be sound near, in english)
